App.js is our root component.
This is where all components MEET.

ðŸŸ£ #1 HTML code is exported
ðŸŸ£ #2 In React, we can split our code in different files.
ðŸŸ  For the Smooth Scroll, I can do the following: <a href='#services'> services </a>
which will connect to the ID'd element, e.g <section id='service'></section>
html: scroll-behavior: smooth
section: scroll-margin-top: 4rem; 
ðŸŸ£ #3 Values should be stored in different files and then utilized when needed. What does that do?
It keeps the code clean, well maintained.
